EllipsisUI for Kodi IS NOT IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT
=====================================

About EllipsisUI
==============

EllipsisUI is a Graphical User Interface for Kodi, a media playback application available on multiple platforms.

The aim with EllipsisUI is to make the navigation and use of Kodi as user friendly as possible, so easy to use infact that a young child can use it just as easily as her grandmother can.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to install and use EllipsisUI using Kodi:
====================================

Copy the 'skin.ellipsisui' folder that is found in the zip file to your Kodi/addons/ directory.
This folder may be different depending where you installed to. When you have copied it
over go to the Appearance Options and in the Skin selection window, choose EllipsisUI.

You may also install direct from within Kodi's addon manager.

-------------------------------------------------
Upgrading previous EllipsisUI versions to a newer one:
=================================================

Do NOT overwrite EllipsisUI, many files change and leaving old files will result in adverse
effects. Make sure you fully delete your EllipsisUI folder from Kodi/addons/ and then overwrite with
the new one found in this zip file.
