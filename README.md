About EllipsisUI
=====================================

EllipsisUI is a Graphical User Interface for Kodi, a media playback application available on multiple platforms.

The aim with EllipsisUI is to resurrect and improve Ellipsis by Team Blackbolt. EllipsisUI is a fork of the original Ellipsis project. 
The goal for Ellipsis was to make the navigation and use of Kodi as user friendly as possible, so easy to use infact that a young child can use it just as easily as her grandmother can.
